## Description
The Book Search Engine is a powerful web application designed for book lovers seeking an easy and intuitive way to explore and manage their reading lists. Built on the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js—the app offers a seamless user experience, allowing users to search for books, save their favorites, and customize their reading lists. It utilizes the Google Books API to provide access to an extensive library of titles, enabling users to discover a diverse range of books across various genres and authors. Users can create accounts for secure login, which allows them to save their preferred books and easily manage their collections by adding or removing titles from their saved lists, all within a streamlined and user-friendly interface.
